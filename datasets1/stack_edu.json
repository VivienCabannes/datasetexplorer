It can also be used to synthesize a rationale to answer questions. The answer may be verified, either with parser checking for numerical equality (i.e. `\\frac13` = `0.333`), or using LLM as a judge. Synthesized questions (bootstrapped from existing one), synthesized, eventually verified, answers."
