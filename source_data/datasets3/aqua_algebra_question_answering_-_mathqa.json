    "summary": "AQuA-RAT is a collection of ~100k crowd-sourced algebra word problems, each with 5 multiple-choice options and a detailed rationalized answer&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:81]{index=81}. The questions are GMAT/GRE style math problems requiring reasoning. A subsequent MathQA dataset re-formatted 37k of these with structured rationale annotations.",
    "size": "~100,000 questions with rationales&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:82]{index=82} (AQuA-RAT). MathQA (2019) uses a refined subset of 37k questions with programs.",
    "download": "AQuA-RAT: via DeepMind\u2019s dataset (on GitHub). MathQA: on GitHub (math-qa) and HuggingFace `math_qa`.",

    "notes": "Each problem in AQuA has a free-form rationale text explaining the solution and the correct option. MathQA further provides a functional program representation of the solution. These datasets target math reasoning and are often used for training models to perform arithmetic with explanations.",
