Each question has 4 options and includes a short explanation. The questions were written by crowdworkers who were shown a factoid or science paragraph and asked to create a question.",

    "companion": "https://aclanthology.org/D17-1193 (Welbl et al. 2017, SciQ paper)",
    "notes": "Since workers had a reference text, the questions are often answerable with a single sentence from a science fact, and an explanation sentence is provided. It's simpler than ARC and OpenBookQA but useful for studying how explanations help. Sometimes used for data augmentation or as a source of scientific QA with rationales.",
