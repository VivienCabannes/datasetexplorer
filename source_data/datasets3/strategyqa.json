E.g., \"Could Brooke Shields have been friends with Marilyn Monroe?\" (Answer: No, explanation: Monroe died before Shields was born). It tests creative multi-hop reasoning and is often used in evaluating explanation-generation (the provided rationales).", "tags": ["crowd-sourced", "QA", "atomic", "with rationale", "answer:verifiable", "question:crowd-sourced", "answer:crowd-sourced", "rationale:human", "domain:nlp"]}
