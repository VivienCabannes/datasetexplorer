The dataset includes the emotion label (e.g., sad, angry) for the situation and the conversation. It\u2019s used to train chatbots that better recognize and respond to user emotions. Not QA; model quality is measured by how well it aligns with human empathetic responses.", "tags": ["crowd-sourced", "dialog", "atomic", "domain:nlp"]}
