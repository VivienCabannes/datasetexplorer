It includes 7,787 multiple-choice questions (4 options) covering science topics from elementary and middle school levels&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:68]{index=68}. Two subsets: ARC-Easy (simple questions answerable with a single fact) and ARC-Challenge (hard questions requiring inference or multiple facts).",

    "notes": "Each question also comes with a corpus of science facts (14M sentences) for retrieval. The challenge set is especially difficult for NLP models. This dataset spurred research in text retrieval + inference for QA. It\u2019s included in the AI2 Leaderboard and used in many evaluations of model knowledge.",
