    "notes": "In SelfRC, questions are answerable from a single plot (one of the pair). In ParaphraseRC, question is based on one plot summary but must be answered from the other, testing cross-document reasoning and paraphrase understanding. Answers are free-form text (often phrases from the target plot).",
