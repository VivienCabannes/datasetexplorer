  "name": "GlaiveAI Reasoning v1-20M",
  "summary": "GlaiveAI Reasoning v1-20M is a substantial dataset comprising 20 million examples, totaling approximately 87 GB. It consists of reasoning traces distilled from the DeepSeek-R1 model, encompassing tasks across mathematics, coding, and science domains. The dataset is designed to facilitate the training and evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks. Notably, the dataset does not include verification of correctness for the reasoning traces, which may impact its applicability in certain contexts.",
