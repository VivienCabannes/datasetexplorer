Here's the completed dataset card for **Līla**:

- **name**: Līla

- **summary**: Līla is a comprehensive benchmark for mathematical reasoning, encompassing over 140,000 natural language questions annotated with Python programs and natural language instructions. The benchmark integrates 23 diverse tasks across four dimensions:
  1. **Mathematical abilities**: Tasks range from arithmetic to calculus.
  2. **Language format**: Includes question-answering and fill-in-the-blank formats.
  3. **Language diversity**: Covers simple to complex language structures.
  4. **External knowledge**: Some tasks require commonsense or domain-specific knowledge.

  The dataset is constructed by extending 20 existing datasets, collecting task instructions and solutions in the form of Python programs to provide explainable solutions alongside correct answers. 

- **size**: Over 140,000 questions across 23 tasks. 

- **download**: The dataset is available for download at [https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/lila](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/lila). 

- **companion**: The dataset is introduced in the paper "Līla: A Unified Benchmark for Mathematical Reasoning," accessible at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17517](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17517). 

- **notes**: Līla includes multiple splits to evaluate models under different conditions:
  - **Līla-IID**: In-distribution split with train, dev, and test sets.
  - **Līla-OOD**: Out-of-distribution split to assess generalization.
  - **Līla-Robust**: Split designed to test robustness to language perturbations.

  The benchmark also features a public leaderboard to track progress in mathematical reasoning tasks. 

- **tags**: "compilation", "QA", "benchmark", "answer:verifiable", "question:human", "answer:human", "mathematics"

This card provides a comprehensive overview of the Līla dataset, highlighting its structure, content, and significance in evaluating and advancing mathematical reasoning capabilities in language models.
