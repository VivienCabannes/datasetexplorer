Here's the completed dataset card for **LeetCode (greengerong version)**:

- **name**: LeetCode (greengerong version)

- **summary**: This dataset comprises a collection of programming problems sourced from LeetCode, a platform renowned for its extensive array of coding challenges used primarily for technical interview preparation. The dataset includes problem statements and example solutions. However, it lacks accompanying unit tests, which are crucial for validating the correctness of solutions. The specific methodology employed for data collection is not detailed, and the dataset appears to have limited coverage compared to the full spectrum of problems available on LeetCode. Consequently, while it may serve as a foundational resource, its utility might be constrained due to these limitations.

- **size**: Approximately 2,000 samples, totaling around 7 MB.

- **download**: The dataset is accessible at [https://huggingface.co/datasets/greengerong/leetcode](https://huggingface.co/datasets/greengerong/leetcode).

- **notes**: The dataset's absence of unit tests and unspecified data collection methods may impact its effectiveness for certain applications. Users should exercise caution and consider supplementing it with additional resources or creating custom unit tests to ensure comprehensive evaluation of code solutions.

- **tags**: "human", "QA", "compilation", "answer:verifiable", "question:human", "answer:human", "programming"
