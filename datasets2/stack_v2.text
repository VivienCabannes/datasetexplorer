Here's the completed dataset card for **The Stack v2**:

- **name**: The Stack v2

- **summary**: The Stack v2 is a comprehensive dataset of software source code, compiled by the BigCode project in collaboration with Software Heritage. It encompasses over 3 billion files across more than 600 programming and markup languages, sourced from the Software Heritage archive as of September 2023. This dataset serves as a substantial resource for training and evaluating large language models (LLMs) for code generation and understanding. 

- **size**: The dataset comprises approximately 5.5 billion samples, totaling around 67.5 terabytes of data. 

- **download**: Access to The Stack v2 requires an agreement with Software Heritage and INRIA. Interested parties should contact datasets@softwareheritage.org for more information. 

- **companion**: The dataset is accompanied by the paper "StarCoder2 and The Stack v2: The Next Generation," accessible at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19173](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19173). 

- **notes**: The Stack v2 is an evolution of the original Stack dataset, significantly expanding its scope and size. It includes a diverse range of programming languages and has been curated to support the development of code-focused LLMs. The dataset is structured to facilitate research in code generation, understanding, and related tasks. 

- **tags**: "human", "monolithic", "compilation", "programming"

This card provides a comprehensive overview of The Stack v2 dataset, highlighting its structure, content, and relevance to research in code-related large language models.
