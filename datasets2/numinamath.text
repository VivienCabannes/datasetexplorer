Here's the completed dataset card for **NuminaMath 1.5**:

- **name**: NuminaMath 1.5

- **summary**: NuminaMath 1.5 is the second iteration of the NuminaMath dataset, comprising approximately 900,000 competition-level math problems. Each problem is accompanied by a solution formatted in a Chain of Thought (CoT) manner. The dataset sources include:
  - **aops_forum**: Problems from the Art of Problem Solving community.
  - **amc_aime**: American Mathematics Competitions and AIME problems.
  - **cn_k12**: Chinese high school math exercises.
  - **gsm8k**: Grade School Math problems.
  - **math**: Various math problems.
  - **olympiads**: International mathematics olympiad competition problems.
  - **orca_math**: Problems from the Orca-Math dataset.
  - **synthetic_math**: Synthetic math problems.

  The dataset was primarily collected from online exam paper PDFs and mathematics discussion forums. Each problem includes metadata such as the final answer, problem type (e.g., Algebra, Geometry), and question type (e.g., multiple-choice, proof). 

- **size**: Approximately 900,000 samples, totaling 531 MB. 

- **download**: The dataset is available for download at [https://huggingface.co/datasets/AI-MO/NuminaMath-1.5](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AI-MO/NuminaMath-1.5). 

- **notes**: NuminaMath 1.5 introduces several enhancements over its predecessor, including the addition of problem metadata for verifiability and the inclusion of manually curated data from various contests. Notably, synthetic datasets like `synthetic_amc` were removed due to their negative impact on performance. 

- **tags**: "human", "QA", "compilation", "answer:verifiable", "with rationale", "question:human", "answer:human", "rationale:human", "mathematics"

This card provides a comprehensive overview of the NuminaMath 1.5 dataset, highlighting its structure, content, and relevance to mathematical problem-solving research.
