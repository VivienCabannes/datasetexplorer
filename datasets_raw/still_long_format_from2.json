  "name": "STILL Long Format",
  "summary": "STILL Long Format is a dataset comprising 5,000 complex problems emphasizing long-form answers. The questions are sourced from diverse platforms, including NuminaMath, AIME, Leetcode, OpenCoder, Camel, Gaokao (Chinese A-level), and RiddleSense. Each problem is designed to elicit detailed, structured responses, facilitating the evaluation of models' capabilities in generating comprehensive solutions.",
  "size": "The dataset contains 5,000 samples with a total storage footprint of approximately 20 MB.",
  "download": "The dataset is available for download at [https://huggingface.co/datasets/RUC-AIBOX/long_form_thought_data_5k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RUC-AIBOX/long_form_thought_data_5k).",
  "companion": "The dataset is accompanied by the paper \"Imitate, Explore, and Self-Improve: A Reproduction Report on Slow-thinking Reasoning Systems,\" accessible at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09413](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09413).",
  "notes": "STILL Long Format is part of the STILL framework, which focuses on slow-thinking reasoning systems that engage in extended reasoning processes before arriving at solutions. The dataset is structured in JSONL format, with each entry containing:",
  "question": "The problem statement.",
  "combined_text": "The model's response, divided into 'thought' (the reasoning process) and 'solution' (the final answer).",
