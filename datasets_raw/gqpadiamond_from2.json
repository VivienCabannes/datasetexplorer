  "companion": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12022",
  "notes": "The Diamond subset represents the most difficult questions within the GPQA benchmark, designed to be 'Google-proof' and requiring deep subject matter expertise. Expert validators achieved 65% accuracy, while highly skilled non-experts reached only 34%, despite unrestricted web access and extended time per question. This subset serves as a rigorous test for assessing advanced reasoning and knowledge in language models.",
