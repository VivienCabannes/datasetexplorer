  "name": "CodeContests",
  "summary": "CodeContests is a comprehensive dataset curated by DeepMind to support machine learning research in competitive programming. It comprises programming problems sourced from multiple platforms, including Aizu, AtCoder, CodeChef, Codeforces, and HackerEarth. Each problem is accompanied by test cases in the form of paired inputs and outputs, as well as both correct and incorrect human solutions in various programming languages. This dataset was instrumental in training AlphaCode, DeepMind's code generation system designed to tackle complex programming challenges.",
  "size": "Approximately 13,000 samples, totaling around 2 GB.",
  "download": "The dataset is available for download at [https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepmind/code_contests](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepmind/code_contests).",
  "companion": "The dataset is introduced in the paper \"Competition-Level Code Generation with AlphaCode,\" accessible at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07814](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07814).",
  "notes": "CodeContests includes both correct and incorrect solutions, providing a rich dataset for training and debugging models. The problems are sourced from reputable competitive programming platforms, ensuring a diverse range of challenges. The dataset's structure facilitates research in code synthesis, analysis of programming techniques, and the development of educational tools for programming instruction.",
