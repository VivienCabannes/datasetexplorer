    "summary": "A collection of 974 crowd-sourced Python programming tasks designed for entry-level programmers&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:85]{index=85}. Each task has a short natural language prompt (problem description), a reference solution, and 3 simple test cases. The goal is to generate correct code that passes the tests.",
    "size": "974 problems&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:86]{index=86} (MBPP official). They are split into 374 for training, 90 for validation, 500 for test in the original paper.",

    "companion": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07732 (Austin et al. 2021, MBPP in the context of program synthesis with LMs)",
    "notes": "Problems cover basic algorithms, string manipulation, etc., solvable in a few lines. Human-written solutions and test cases are provided. The evaluation typically measures the fraction of problems solved (i.e., code passes all tests). Often used to fine-tune or evaluate code generation models, complementary to HumanEval (MBPP has more but simpler tasks).",
