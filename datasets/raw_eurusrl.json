  "notes": "Eurus-RL aggregates problems from sources like NuminaMath-CoT, APPS, CodeContests, TACO, and Codeforces. The dataset underwent rigorous filtering to ensure problem solvability and answer correctness, including reformatting multiple-choice questions to open-ended formats and removing duplicates. It supports research in reinforcement learning for complex reasoning tasks.",
