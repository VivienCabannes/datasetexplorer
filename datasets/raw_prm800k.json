  "notes": "Developed by OpenAI to support research in training reliable models for complex multi-step reasoning tasks. The dataset provides step-level human feedback, enabling the development of process reward models (PRMs) that evaluate intermediate steps in problem-solving. Some annotations have been reported to be incorrect, which may impact model training and evaluation.",
