Here's the completed dataset card for **MegaMath**:

- **name**: MegaMath

- **summary**: MegaMath is an extensive open math pretraining dataset curated by the LLM360 team, encompassing over 300 billion tokens. The dataset is constructed through three primary efforts:
  1. **Revisiting web data**: Re-extraction of mathematical documents from Common Crawl with math-oriented HTML optimizations, fastText-based filtering, and deduplication to acquire higher-quality data from the internet.
  2. **Recalling math-related code data**: Identification of high-quality math-related code from large code training corpora, such as Stack-V2, to enhance data diversity.
  3. **Exploring synthetic data**: Generation of QA-style text, math-related code, and interleaved text-code blocks from web or code data.

  MegaMath aims to push the limits of open math corpora by providing a large-scale, high-quality dataset for pretraining language models in mathematical reasoning. citeturn0search0

- **size**: Approximately 215 million samples totaling 371.6 billion tokens. citeturn0search0

- **companion**: The dataset is introduced in the paper "MegaMath: Pushing the Limits of Open Math Corpora," accessible at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02807](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02807). citeturn0search0

- **notes**: MegaMath surpasses previous open math pretraining datasets, such as DeepSeekMath, by over 30% in token count. Extensive experiments during development led to optimized practices for text extraction, deduplication, and fastText training, ensuring high data quality. Training language models on MegaMath has demonstrated a 15% to 20% performance boost on ten downstream benchmarks, underscoring its efficacy. citeturn0search0
