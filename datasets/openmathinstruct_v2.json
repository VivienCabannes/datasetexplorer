Here's the completed dataset card for **OpenMathInstruct-2**:

- **name**: OpenMathInstruct-2

- **summary**: OpenMathInstruct-2 is a large-scale synthetic dataset comprising approximately 14 million question-solution pairs, derived from around 600,000 unique mathematical questions. The dataset was created by augmenting existing benchmarks, such as MATH and GSM8K, using the Llama3.1 family of models to generate solutions. This augmentation aimed to enhance the training of large language models in mathematical reasoning tasks. citeturn0search1
