Here's the completed dataset card for **GSM8K**:

- **name**: GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K)

- **summary**: GSM8K is a dataset comprising 8,500 high-quality, linguistically diverse grade school math word problems, designed to evaluate and enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of language models. Each problem requires between 2 to 8 steps to solve, primarily involving basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The dataset is structured to challenge models with multi-step problem-solving, reflecting tasks that a proficient middle school student should be able to solve. 

- **size**: 8,500 problems, with 7,500 designated for training and 1,000 for testing. 

- **download**: The dataset is available for download at [https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math). 

- **companion**: The dataset is introduced in the paper "Training Verifiers to Solve Math Word Problems," accessible at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14168](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14168). 

- **notes**: GSM8K was collaboratively developed by OpenAI and Surge AI, with human problem writers crafting each question to ensure linguistic diversity and adherence to grade-school mathematical concepts. The dataset includes both questions and detailed solutions, formatted to facilitate the training and evaluation of language models in mathematical reasoning. 

- **tags**: "human", "QA", "benchmark", "answer:verifiable", "question:human", "answer:human", "mathematics"
