Here's the completed dataset card for **Lean-Workbook**:

- **name**: Lean-Workbook

- **summary**: Lean-Workbook is a comprehensive dataset comprising tens of thousands of mathematical problems formalized in Lean 4. Developed to support autoformalization model training and automated theorem proving, it includes both natural language statements and their corresponding formal representations in Lean 4. The dataset is structured into two main splits:
  - **Lean Workbook**: Contains 57,231 problems.
  - **Lean Workbook Plus**: Comprises 82,893 problems.

  Each problem is provided with its natural language statement, formal statement, and, where available, formal proofs. This resource aims to bridge the gap between informal mathematical language and formal proofs, facilitating advancements in mathematical reasoning and theorem proving using Lean 4. 

- **size**: Approximately 57,231 problems in the Lean Workbook split and 82,893 problems in the Lean Workbook Plus split. 

- **download**: The dataset is available for download at [https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/Lean-Workbook](https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/Lean-Workbook). 

- **companion**: The dataset is introduced in the paper "Lean Workbook: A large-scale Lean problem set formalized from natural language math problems," accessible at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03847](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03847). 

- **notes**: The Lean-Workbook dataset was developed using an iterative autoformalization pipeline that translates natural language mathematical problems into Lean 4 statements and vice versa. This process involved generating and filtering synthetic data to ensure high-quality formalizations. The dataset supports research in autoformalization and automated theorem proving, providing a valuable resource for training models to understand and generate formal mathematical proofs.
