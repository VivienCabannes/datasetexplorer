  "notes": "NuminaMath 1.5 enhances its predecessor by adding problem metadata for verifiability, manually curated data from various contests, and removing synthetic datasets like 'synthetic_amc' due to their negative impact on performance. The dataset sources include Art of Problem Solving community problems, American Mathematics Competitions, Chinese high school math exercises, and international mathematics olympiad problems.",
