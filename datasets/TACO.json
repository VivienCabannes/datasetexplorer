Here's the completed dataset card for **TACO: Topics in Algorithmic Code Generation**:

- **name**: TACO: Topics in Algorithmic Code Generation

- **summary**: TACO is an open-source, large-scale code generation dataset focused on algorithmic problems. It aggregates 26,443 programming challenges from platforms like CodeChef, CodeForces, HackerRank, GeeksforGeeks, and existing datasets such as APPS, CodeContest, and Description2code. Each problem is accompanied by unit tests to ensure solution correctness. 

- **size**: The dataset comprises 26,443 problems and 1,539,152 verified Python 3 code solutions. The training set contains 25,443 problems, while the test set includes 1,000 problems. On average, each problem features 58.21 correct code solutions. 

- **download**: The dataset is available for download at [https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/TACO](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/TACO).

- **companion**: The dataset is accompanied by the paper "TACO: Topics in Algorithmic COde generation dataset," accessible at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14852](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14852).

- **notes**: TACO provides fine-grained labels for each problem, including task topics, algorithms, programming skills, and difficulty levels, offering precise references for training and evaluating code generation models. The dataset emphasizes Python 3 solutions due to Python's restrictive syntactic rules, leading to cleaner and more discernible code structures. 

- **tags**: "human", "QA", "compilation", "answer:verifiable", "with rationale", "question:human", "answer:human", "rationale:human", "programming"
