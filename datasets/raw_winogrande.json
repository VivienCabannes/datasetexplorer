  "notes": "Each problem presents a sentence with an ambiguous pronoun and two possible referents; the task is to choose the correct one. Example: 'The trophy didn't fit in the suitcase because ___ was too big.' (Options: trophy or suitcase). WinoGrande was created through crowdsourcing with adversarial filtering to reduce biases, making it more challenging than the original Winograd Schema Challenge.",
